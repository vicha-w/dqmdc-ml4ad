# Planning

* Add tutorial to create a django viewset with CERN's SSO auth
* Add tutorial to create a simple React component
* Test Spark (in SWAN) for quick data retrieval from PostgreSQL;
* HTCondor jobs as virtual celery workers for DQMIO file processing;
* Current data architecture is scalable? Maybe implement a Data Lakehouse;
* Model registry (model binary + pre-processor script);
* Model registration and continuous inference;
* Develop general Auto Encoder;
* Porting to application to Online DQM.
