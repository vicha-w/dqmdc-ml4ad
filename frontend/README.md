# Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is an Single Page Application (SPA) built using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) trough the [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) project and it integrates with the backend by calling REST Api methods and parsing the returned JSON response.

## Available Scripts

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

* `yarn run build:prod`
